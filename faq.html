									<!-- Question -->
									<button class="accordion">What is a Homeowners Association?</button>
									<div class="panel">
										<p>The Maryland Homeowners Association Act defines a homeowners association (HOA) as a person or entity with the authority to enforce the provisions of a declaration. HOAs are corporations that are created to manage planned communities, and their main purpose is to protect home values and maintain common areas. They are governed by their own documents, which include rules and regulations that vary from association to association. Some key things to know about HOAs in Maryland include:</p>
									 		<ul>
									    		<li><u>Membership</u> - Homeowners are automatically part of the HOA when they purchase a property in an HOA-controlled community.</li>
									    		<li><u>Assessments</u> - HOAs collect regular assessments from homeowners to cover the cost of maintaining the neighborhood.</li>
									    		<li><u>Legal standards</u> - HOAs and their boards of directors are subject to many of the same legal standards as corporate boards.</li>
									    		<li><u>Enforcement</u> -  HOAs can ask the circuit court to order homeowners to stop or fix violations, and the court can order homeowners to take action.</li>
									    		<li><u>Establishment</u> - To establish an HOA in Maryland, Articles of Incorporation must be created and filed with the State Department.</li>
									  		</ul>
									</div>

									<!-- Question -->
									<button class="accordion">Where can I find a copy of the MD HOA Act?</button>
									<div class="panel">
										<p>
											The Maryland Homeowners Association Act can be found on the <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/" target="_blank">MD General Assembly Website</a>. Go to Laws -> Statutes, select ‘Real Property’ under the ‘Articles’ dropdown and navigate to Section 11B. The Maryland Homeowners Association Act is section 11B-101 through 11B-118.
										</p>
									</div>

									<!-- Question -->
									<button class="accordion">What is a Board of Directors?</button>
									<div class="panel">
										<p>In Maryland, a board of directors is a governing body for a homeowners association that is responsible for making decisions and determining policies for the association. The board of directors is responsible for the following:</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Ensuring that the association is run properly, including maintaining common areas, collecting fees, and ensuring that fees are fair.</li>
										    <li>Ensuring that the community's governing documents are followed and enforced.</li>
										    <li>Holding regular meetings to address association business, providing adequate notice to members.</li>
										    <li>Managing the budget, including maintaining a reserve fund.</li>
										    <li>Providing adequate insurance coverage.</li>
										    <li>Managing elections.</li>
									  	</ul>
									  	<p>The Wilson’s Grove Board of Directors is made up of elected volunteers from the community. Positions include president, vice president, and treasurer.</p>
									</div>

									<!-- Question -->
									<button class="accordion">What are the governing documents for a HOA?</button>
									<div class="panel">
										<p>Some of the governing documents for a homeowners association (HOA) include (in hierarchical order):</p>
										<ul>
								    		<li><u>Plat</u> - A recorded map that shows the location of the community and its structures, including units, lots, common areas, and limited common areas. The plat outlines the jurisdiction of the association. (Also known as a subdivision map).</li>
										    <li><u>Declaration of Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (CC&R)</u> - Provides the HOA with the power to enforce certain rules of the association. This is required to be signed by new home owners, and constitutes the contract between the homeowner and the association. The CC&Rs includes the association's covenant for assessments, which gives the association the right to charge dues to members.</li>
										    <li><u>Articles of Incorporation</u> - Establishes the HOA as a legal entity (non-profit organization) and defines its name, purpose, and corporate structure.</li>
										    <li><u>Bylaws</u> -  Outlines the duties and responsibilities of the board, including meeting requirements, how many seats are on the board, election procedures, and members' voting rights.</li>
										    <li><u>Rules & Regulations </u> - Goes into more specifics compared to the CC&R. CC&R gives the HOA the right to enforce the rules and regulations and documents some of those rules and regulations. The R&R provides greater detail into what is being enforced. The HOA has the authority to create new rules and regulations (subject to federal and state laws). If the R&R conflicts with the CC&R, the CC&R takes precedence.</li>
								  		</ul>
